# OdisaDevelopmentDashboard
Odisha Development Dashboard 🚀
A modern, interactive web dashboard for analyzing and visualizing Odisha’s development data—powered by Wolfram Language and Wolfram Cloud.

🌟 Overview
This project delivers a unified, interactive platform for exploring Odisha’s key development metrics including literacy rates, agricultural output, infrastructure growth, economic indicators, and health statistics.
Designed for government officials, citizens, and researchers, it enables data-driven decisions, real-time visualizations, and advanced analytics using Wolfram Language.

✨ Features
Dynamic Data Visualizations (GeoRegionValuePlot, BarChart, TimeSeries, BubbleChart)

Interactive Controls: Select metrics, districts, and time ranges

Correlation & Predictive Analytics using Wolfram’s computational power

Responsive UI: Beautiful frontend, desktop & mobile friendly, dark/light modes

Wolfram Cloud API Integration: Real-time backend computations and chart generation

Export Reports: Generate professional PDFs/CSVs from live data

Secure & Scalable: Cloud deployment, API endpoints, permissions
